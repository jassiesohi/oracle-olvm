# Migrating a self-hosted engine in KVM 4.5 from one storage to another involves several steps. Letâ€™s break it down:

# Back up the original Manager:
# Use the engine-backup tool to create a backup of the existing Manager.
# Deploy a new self-hosted engine:
# Set up a new self-hosted engine instance.
# Restore the backup:
# Restore the backup created in step 1 onto the new self-hosted engine.
# Enable the Manager repositories:
# On the new Manager virtual machine, ensure that the Manager repositories are enabled.
# Reinstall the self-hosted engine nodes:
# Update the configuration of the self-hosted engine nodes by reinstalling them.
# Remove the old self-hosted engine storage domain:
# Clean up the old storage domain associated with the previous storage.

# These are the steps you need to follow
# how to gracefully stop engine and the HA before maintain the two host-engine servers
# 1. Shutdown all VMs through oVirt UI except Hosted Engine(HE) VM
# 2. Then move the HE VM into global maintenance On one of the hosts
hosted-engine --set-maintenance --mode=global

# 3. Poweroff HE VM.
hosted-engine --vm-shutdown 
# (To ensure graceful shutdown check status)
hosted-engine --vm-status
# 4. Once the HE VM is down then power off all hosts
